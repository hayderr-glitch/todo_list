# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built with Flutter. It allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete todo items.

## Features

- **Add Todo Items**: Easily add new tasks to your list using the input field.
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of a todo item by tapping the checkbox.
- **Delete Todo Items**: Remove tasks from your list using the delete icon.

## How to Use

1.  **Add a Task**: Type your task in the text field at the top and press Enter or tap the '+' icon.
2.  **Mark as Complete/Incomplete**: Tap the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete or incomplete.
3.  **Delete a Task**: Tap the trash can icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
